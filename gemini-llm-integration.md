# Gemini LLM Integration

This guide explains how to connect the MCP server tools to the Gemini LLM.

## Overview

The integration allows the Gemini LLM to call the tools hosted on the MCP server to perform actions.

## Steps

1.  **Expose Tool Definitions:**
    - The MCP server needs to expose the definitions of the available tools to the Gemini LLM.
    - This is typically done via an API endpoint that returns the tool definitions in a format that Gemini can understand (e.g., OpenAPI specification).

2.  **Handle Tool Calls from Gemini:**
    - When Gemini wants to use a tool, it will send a tool call request to the MCP server.
    - The MCP server needs to parse this request, execute the corresponding tool with the provided parameters, and return the result to Gemini.

3.  **Authentication:**
    - Secure the connection between Gemini and the MCP server using API keys or OAuth.

## Example Workflow

1.  User sends a prompt to Gemini.
2.  Gemini determines that it needs to use a tool to answer the prompt.
3.  Gemini sends a tool call request to the MCP server.
4.  The MCP server executes the tool and returns the output.
5.  Gemini uses the tool's output to generate a response for the user.
